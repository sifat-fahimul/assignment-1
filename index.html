                <h3>Biriyani Recipies</h3>
                <p>When it comes to biryani, I always go with chicken. Bone-in chicken pieces like drumstick or
                    leg-thigh pieces make excellent biryanis. I seldom make mutton or goat biryani as I am not a fan of
                    mutton. I love beef but havenâ€™t tried making biryani with it.

                    Last week, I had received an email from one my readers asking me to share the recipe for making beef
                    biryani. I had been thinking of making beef biryani for so long, and now the email request inspired
                    me to make up my mind to make beef biryani over the weekend.</p>

                <h3>Haleem Recipies</h3>
                <p>Haleem is a rich mutton stew, popular in the Middle East and Asia. As common as it is in India,
                    particularly in Hyderabad, it is surprising to know that Haleem actually has Persian roots. It is
                    eaten in plenty of other parts of the world but most commonly by Muslims, especially in the holy
                    month of Ramadan, for the Iftar while breaking their fast.Ingredients of Haleem Recipe | Haleem:
                    With lentils, spices and broken wheat, it is a slow-cooked delicacy usually enjoyed during Eid
                    festivities.</p>

                <h3>Khichdi Recipies</h3>
                <p>Khichdi is synonymous to 'comfort' for all. It is one of the quickest meals we can choose to make on
                    a lazy or a busy day. But did you ever imagine pairing a bowl of khichdi with chicken? Don't be
                    surprised! We bring you a rich and luscious recipe from Bengal that may change your perception about
                    khichdi. It's called Bhuna Khichuri (or Bhuni Khichuri). This one-pot meal is basically a dried and
                    spicier version of khichdi that includes oodles of ghee and dry fruits. You can find both veg and
                    non-veg version of bhuna khichuri recipe.
